### Description

Allows you to AFK trade with villagers.

Player movement is not part of this mod. You have to move between villagers and input and output containers using minecart, water stream or other methods. Use a light sensor to trade only once per day per villager to keep prices from climbing.

Default keybind for options GUI: Right-Shift+T

Beginning with version v0.0.10 you can select the sell/buy items using nametagged items in items frames and the input/output containers by placing colored glass blocks nearby.

if you can't access settings via the keybind, try modmenu https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu

- Minecraft 1.21.7
